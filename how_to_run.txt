To run the app:

Please install docker, java 21, maven.

Go to /bash_scripts.
First run the db_setup.bash script - it should start a docker container with mysql 8.0 running. The container is
scheduled for 3306 port (default docker). Then the script will attempt to populate the db with initial tables and values.
If everything is ok, "All SQL scripts executed successfully." Should be printed.

If the docker container runs properly and the db is filled, run (consider a detached terminal)
mvn spring-boot::run
in the repo directory, it should start the app on localhost:8080.

For a live use case, please run app_preview.bash - it will run two sequences of how the app could be used. If everything
is ok, the respective curl requests and responses should appear, ending with "All requests completed."

Feel free to fiddle around with the app, hopefully you break something :)
